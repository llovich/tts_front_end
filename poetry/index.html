<h1>the Mystery of the Pears</h1>
<h2>by Richard Siken</h2>

<article>
<p style="padding-left:20px;">I looked at the pears. I painted the pears, what they<br>
were like. I waited for the pears to reveal their<br>
mystery. Five brown pears in a chipped white bowl,<br>
soft and scarred and blushing yellow in the throbbing<br>
dark. They shine in their suits. I hung them on<br/>
the wall. Precise. A landmark. You might like it here. <br>
I think that you might like it here.</p>
